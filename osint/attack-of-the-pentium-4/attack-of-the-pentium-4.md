You really want to play Run 3, but your poor Pentium 4 isn't fast enough! You've heard there's a computer shop worthy of thunderous praise in this building, but you need an expert opinion on their services first. If a computer is good enough to work on games, it should be good enough to play them. It’s been rumored that someone who works on games once purchased a computer from here. Can you find their first game?

Flag format: `UMASS{name of the game in English}`, for example `UMASS{Elden Ring}`

Flag: `UMASS{Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors}`

Solve: To get address of the building, either read the street sign or read the store sign, go to rad-japan.co.jp, and get the address from there. Search the address on Google, find www.wistech-ltd.com, choose PC Zeus, go to the examples section, find 土屋昇平様 (Shohei Tsuchiya), vgmpf.com lists his first game as Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors.

I've solved it both on English Google and Japanese Google and found that it's a bit easier on the latter.
