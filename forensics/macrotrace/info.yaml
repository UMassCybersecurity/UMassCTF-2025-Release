  A suspicious spreadsheet surfaced from the archive of a defunct Flash game studio. Opening it does... something, but whatever was there is now gone.

  Your mission: reverse the macro, trace what it did, and recover the flag it tried to destroy.

  Use `23ab3Y9/]jKl` as the password when extracting the password-protected zip archive.
