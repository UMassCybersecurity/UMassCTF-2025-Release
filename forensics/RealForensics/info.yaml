  I've noticed one of my business competitors suddenly knows about some top secret company data.  The files were only stored on my desktop, so I think they may have hacked me!

  I've provided a pcap of around the time the data got leaked.  Can you figure out what happened?

  Note - this chall contains malware and requires some rev.
